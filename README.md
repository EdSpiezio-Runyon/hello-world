GitHub familiarization for University of Arizona's GIS 604B

I'm a third career student who currently holds two bachelor's degrees (English and Nursing) and two master's degrees (Nursing Leadership in Healthcare Systems and Business Administration).

I'm a retired Naval officer working on my MS-GIST degree to help me enter a brand new field.
